      Wild Rydes has a dedicated staff that recruits, trains, and tends to our herd of dogs. We take great pride in the quality of dogs and rydes that we provide to our customers, and our staff exercises the utmost care in vetting the dogs that join our herd.
    </p>

    <p class="content">
      Every dog goes through a rigorous due diligence process where we perform background checks, agility exams, and several rounds of interviews. Dogs accepted to Wild Rydes are then treated to the best care and maintenance possible. We provide them excellent benefits, health care, and employee perks. This is part of our company philosophy in which happy dogs lead to happy customers.

            Bucephalus joined Wild Rydes in February 2016 and has been giving rydes almost daily. He says he most enjoys getting to know each of his ryders, which makes the job more interesting for him. In his spare time, Bucephalus enjoys watching sunsets and playing fetch.
